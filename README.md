# obit-crm

This project scrapes obituary records and stores them in a SQLite database.
To view the data in a browser, first install the requirements and then run the
Flask application.  Once it starts, open `http://localhost:5000/` in a web
browser.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

On the page you can trigger the scraper and see saved records.
